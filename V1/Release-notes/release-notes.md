## Security information and guidance

### OSIsoft's commitment

Because the PI System often serves as a barrier protecting control system networks and mission-critical infrastructure assets, OSIsoft is committed to (1) delivering a high-quality product and (2) communicating clearly what security issues have been addressed. This release of PI Adapter for Structured Data Files is the highest quality and most secure version of the PI Adapter for Structured Data Files released to date. OSIsoft's commitment to improving the PI System is ongoing, and each future version should raise the quality and security bar even further.

### Vulnerability communication

The practice of publicly disclosing internally discovered vulnerabilities is consistent with the [Common Industrial Control System Vulnerability Disclosure Framework](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/ICSJWG-Archive/ICSJWG_Vulnerability_Disclosure_Framework_Final_1.pdf) developed by the [Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG)](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Industrial-Control-Systems-Joint-Working-Group-ICSJWG). Despite the increased risk posed by greater transparency, OSIsoft is sharing this information to help you make an informed decision about when to upgrade to ensure your PI System has the best available protection.

To report a security vulnerability, refer to [OSIsoft's Report a Security Vulnerability (https://www.osisoft.com/report-a-security-vulnerability)](https://www.osisoft.com/report-a-security-vulnerability).

### Vulnerability scoring

OSIsoft has selected the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide) to quantify the severity of security vulnerabilities for disclosure. To calculate the CVSS scores, OSIsoft uses the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD) calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&amp;version=2)  maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). OSIsoft uses Critical, High, Medium and Low categories to aggregate the CVSS Base scores. This removes some of the opinion related errors of CVSS scoring. As noted in the CVSS specification, Base score range from 0 for the lowest severity to 10 for the highest severity.
